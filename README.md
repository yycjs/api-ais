# Better APIs and smarter AIs

__Forget about MEAN! Forget about Meteor! Forget about Sails!__

Calgary-grown Feathers - an open-source extension for Express - and your client side library/framework of choice is all you need to build REST APIs and full-stack real-time applications with NodeJS.

We will go over the new features in version 1.1, some powerful plugins that make creating APIs even easier and how to hook everything up to your jQuery, Angular, React or Android or IOS app. Don't want to throw away your existing API but still go real-time? There's a solution for that, too!

__The Machines are coming!__

We briefly talked about AI during our January meetup and showed a web application that can learn touch gestures. Let's dig a little deeper and look into the HTML5 speech API and how to do basic natural language processing using the same neural network library. Don't worry if you haven't completed your rocket science degree yet, it is not as complicated as it sounds. This is the perfect time to learn a little more about the hottest topic in technology right now which does not just drive cars for us but will also change the way we create applications.

Going out with a bang (but going out nonetheless)

If you don't think those two topics have anything in common you might be in for a surprise! We are very excited for this one!
